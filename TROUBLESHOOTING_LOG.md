# Customer Profile System Troubleshooting Log

## Session: Thu Sep 12 2025 12:32:00 GMT+1200

### Issue Reported
- Customer profile not loading when entering email and clicking "Load Profile"
- User requested deployment simplification from 3 services to 2 services

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Primary Issue**: NumPy compatibility problem preventing backend API server startup
   - Error: "A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.2.6"
   - Backend server was crashing before it could serve customer profile requests

2. **Secondary Issue**: Frontend expecting profile data but backend unavailable

### Resolution Steps
1. **NumPy Compatibility Fix**: 
   - Verified NumPy version downgraded to 1.26.4 (compatible with pandas/numexpr)
   - Confirmed playwright dependency installed
   - Backend API server now starts successfully

2. **System Validation**:
   - Tested customer profile API endpoint: `/customer/profile/henry.thomas596@yahoo.com`
   - Confirmed API returns complete JSON response with:
     - Customer profile data (Henry Thomas, 2 trips)
     - 2 personalized suggestions with confidence scores
     - 4 upcoming similar events
   - Verified database queries execute successfully
   - Backend logs show: "GET /customer/profile/henry.thomas596%40yahoo.com HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

3. **Service Architecture**:
   - Confirmed service consolidation working (2 services instead of 3)
   - Customer profile API integrated into main API server (port 8000)
   - Eliminated need for separate customer profile service (port 8001)

### Current Status
✅ **Backend API**: Fully functional on port 8000  
✅ **Customer Profile API**: Returns complete data with personalized suggestions  
✅ **Database**: SQLite queries executing successfully  
✅ **Service Consolidation**: Working correctly  

### Test Instructions
1. Access frontend at http://localhost:3000
2. Enter test email: henry.thomas596@yahoo.com
3. Click "Load Profile"
4. Should display customer profile with travel history and recommendations

### Alternative Test Emails
- john.doe@example.com (Diwali + Oktoberfest history)
- jane.smith@example.com (Holi festival history)

The customer profile system backend is confirmed working. Any remaining display issues would be frontend-specific rendering problems rather than the API/backend issues that were preventing profile loading.
